    <h2>Trade Wars and Economic Policy</h2>

  <section class="content">
    <p>During his presidency, Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries like China, Canada, and the EU. His goal was to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. However, the strategy had mixed results.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Tariffs?</h3>
    <p>Trump claimed that unfair trade practices hurt American workers. Tariffs were used as a weapon to renegotiate trade deals, like NAFTA becoming USMCA.</p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>Some industries benefited, but others, like agriculture and tech, were hit by retaliatory tariffs from other countries. The stock market saw volatility, and consumer prices rose in some sectors.</p>
